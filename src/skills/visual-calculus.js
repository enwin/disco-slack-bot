  description: "Visual calculus verses you not only in the laws of the state, but the laws of nature. It enables you to create virtual crime-scene models in you mind's eye. You'll see how a bullet shattered the glass, and from that trace its trajectory with mathematical precision. You'll also count so many footprints - and at a glance discern shoe size and design; as well as the height weight, and gender of the one who wore them.",
