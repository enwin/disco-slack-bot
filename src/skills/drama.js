  name: 'Drama',
  description: "Drama urges you to treat the world as a stage - and on it, to perform. It enables you to lie, to concoct the most elaborate and wonderful stories; to take on ingenious personas and perform acts of stagecraft in an entertaining amalgam of fourberie and deceit! As well, it enables you to see through would-be actors and their false antics. If they lie, you'll know. Immediately.",
