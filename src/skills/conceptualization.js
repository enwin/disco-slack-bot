  description: "Conceptualization has a special role it wants you to play in this world - not the role of cop, but of Art Cop. It enables you to make fresh assiciations, to delve into world-concepts from Jan Kaarp's postmodernist karperie, to Revachol's arabesque architectural style dideridada, and even the concept of HARDCORE - and then, importantly, to add your own contribution to theses works.",
